Voice - 2019-05

This was the oldest pre-transition voice that I could find that doesn't reveal personal information. This was recorded in German for a university project. I'm not particularly proud of this...

> Ich habe viele Restaurants in Europa begründet und ich habe für viele prominente Personen gekocht. Zum Beispiel, Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel mag mein Schnitzel, Conchita Wurst mag meine Wurst, und Herbert Grönemeyer mag meine Currywurst sehr, dass er darüber gesungen hat.

> Cauliflower, melons, or pumpkins planted in a 3-by-3 pattern can randomly combine into a giant crop. Giant crops drop 15 to 21 items when harvested with any axe, which takes 3 hits. At the start of each day, every possible 3-by-3 grid of crops, including overlaps, has a 1 percent chance to grow into a giant crop as long as the center crop is fully grown and watered, and all constituent crops are of the same type. Giant crops won't necessarily appear on the day the crops finish growing; it can happen any day those criteria are met. Giant crops don't die at change of season like other crops. Just like with wild seeds, soil underneath a giant crop may become untilled causing any fertilizer to be lost. Giant crops cannot grow in the greenhouse or by using garden pots.

This is the standard voice training script that I used to read. It comes from http://www.oulgbtq.org/your-voice.html and I deliberately chose this to remind myself of tips to make voice training easier. In the first recordings I read all three paragraphs, but in the later recordings I just read the first one.

> To deepen your voice, you'll want to try and lower your pitch. To do this, relax your throat as much as possible, to avoid tightening your vocal cords. Moisten your mouth and throat, and hold your chin up. Swallow before you speak, and speak slowly, lowering your voice at the beginning of sentences and trying to maintain that pitch. If you find yourself speaking quickly, you'll probably also find your pitch rising. Try not to raise your pitch at the end of your sentences, but keep your tone more monotonous. Emphasise sounds that allow you to deepen your voice; for example, lengthening your vowels allows you to make them sound deeper. Experiment with what you find easiest to pronounce with your deeper voice and play to those strengths.
> 
> When trying to deepen your voice, you quite literally want to speak from as low down as possible. Pay attention to where you feel and hear your voice emanating from; it'll probably be your throat. Your pitch is highest when you speak at the top of your throat, or when you use your 'head voice'. Speaking from your chest will produce a deeper sound, although it might be airy and a little soft. Ideally, you want to learn how to speak from what feels like your gut. To do this, you'll have to project your voice, which comes from breathing from your diaphragm and reaching down to your belly before you speak. This process of learning to speak from your diaphragm takes a lot of practice, and initially you probably won't hear much of a difference, but in time, you'll be able to make your voice deeper and deeper. It might be frustrating, but take baby steps. If you try to make drastic changes to your voice, you'll risk straining your vocal cords. Avoid speaking with a growl or rasp, as although this produces a deeper throat voice, it can damage your vocal cords and you'll end up with a hoarse voice. It's also more difficult to project when you're speaking from your throat.
>
> Start out by using your deep voice for short periods of time, and gradually build them up. It'll take time, but eventually you'll be able to lower your voice quite substantially, just from practice.

> Okay so before I read the passage, I'm just gonna explain that I've been having colds lately and it's making my voice janky. I get less control over it, so this is not my best sound, but I need to still read. [reads the standard voice training script above]

Voice - 2021-07-13 - 1138 - song

Just me trying to sing "Even the Nights are Better" by Air Supply. Not proud of this either, but I might have another chance to record myself singing the same song with my new voice.

Voice - 2021-08-03 - 1131

> Okay, so I'm trying to record myself speaking in my natural voice after exactly a month of voice training. So, I was in a call yesterday; I think my voice range was mostly in this range. So now I'm recording myself to see whether I like my voice enough to.. if it's low enough for my liking. So I guess let's see.

Voice - 2021-08-04 - 1351

> Hello everyone, this is a recording of my voice. I've been voice training for a month now, and I'm recording to see how my voice sounds like without voice training, like the formal kind of voice training every day. I guess I would save(?) my natural voice and after I record this I will listen to myself to see where I'm at right now. So, I guess that's it. Now let's hear my voice.

Voice - 2021-08-05 - 1128

> Hello, okay, it's time again for my daily voice training session. This is my daily recording before opening the voice training app and training my voice. I just recently started recording my quote-unquote "natural voice" after a month of training to see where I am right now and whether I like the sound of my own voice better than years ago. So, there we go.

Voice - 2021-08-06 - 1341

> Okay, just checking in for my daily voice training session. I'm kinda straining to maintain my desired voice right now maybe because I didn't sleep well last night. Voice training advice is that I should sleep well to rest my vocal cords and diaphragm, and I guess it's showing today. So, I'm gonna do the voice training exercises again to get back on track.

Voice - 2021-08-08 - 1120

> Okay, so this is my daily check-in for my voice training before I open the voice training app. I would say I had a rather good sleep last night and it definitely helped my voice because when voice training it's recommended to sleep well to rest the voice-related muscles. So I guess it's showing because I don't feel like straining to speak. So, yeah, I guess that's it.

Voice - 2021-08-11 - 1147

> Okay so, hello I'm back again for my daily voice training. Actually, I skipped two days because I just had my first dose of vaccine yesterday and my arm still hurts. So it's time for me again to go back on track. This is my daily recording before I start the quote-unquote "formal" lesson. So, here we go.

Voice - 2021-08-12 - 1109

> Okay, yo, okay, daily check in for our voice training daily (well, almost daily, I skip sometimes). Well, yeah, what else do I say? I don't know, random things... When the pawn, when the pawn, when the pawn. Y'all are valid and I love you all, you're all wonderful people. I value you and I don't know what else to say. I'm not even good at ad-libbing, so yeah I'll stop I guess.

Voice - 2021-08-13 - 1107

> Okay, hello hello hello. Daily check-in for voice training before your actual training session. Okay, I just thought I would read a few sentences rather than(?) ad-lib. So, experiment with your breathing. Try to breathe in from your diaphragm, rather than taking shallow breaths. If you take a breath and feel your chest and shoulders rise, you're breathing from your chest, not your diaphragm. When you breathe from your diaphragm, you should feel your stomach expanding and contracting. Yeah, I guess that's it.

Voice - 2021-08-15 - 1602

> Okay so, hello, daily check-in for voice training. Okay, I've been talking, so to speak, but sometimes I don't default to reaching down to my belly while I speak, and it shows in the way I hear myself. So, practice, practice, practice, more practice is needed so that I can develop the muscle memory I guess and the instinct to speak from my belly. So, well, right now I would say I'm speaking from my belly, but I have to practice more so that it comes off spontaneously. So, that's it for now, let's start with the training. 

Voice - 2021-08-15 - 1604

> Okay so, daily check-in for voice training. I had to turn off my fan 'cause it's just noisy and it's very close to me and the microphone. So I'm recording again hopefully with less background noise so that I can hear myself better. I can—how do you call this—measure my progress more. So, let's keep on practicing everyday (well, everyday, that's the goal) so that we can have the muscle memory and the spontaneous speaking from the belly and in time, I wouldn't be ashamed to hear my voice. So that's it, folks.

Voice - 2021-08-16 - 1106

> Okay, hello, daily check-in for voice training. Pardon the background music, I just wanted to get started earlier. So, just a little bit of update: apparently I can now reach lower pitch like C3 or something, but it takes a bit of effort like speaking [incomprehensible], so it's still a conscious effort, an effort that needs to be trained every day. So, here we go.

Voice - 2021-08-17 - 1146

> Okay, hello, so daily check-in for my voice training. I don't know what else to say. Well, I'm just checking my voice, so let's see. [some filler words] Experiment with your breathing. Try to breathe in from your diaphragm rather than taking shallow breaths. If you take a breath and feel you chest and shoulders rise, you're breathing from your chest, not your diaphragm. When you breathe from your diaphragm, you should feel your stomach expanding and contracting. Inhale through your nose and down to your belly and speak when you breathe out. 

Voice - 2021-08-18 - 1133

> Okay, daily check-in for voice training. Honestly my voice is still kinda broken because of colds and stuff. Okay, let's read something. Palacio de La Moneda, or simply La Moneda, is the seat of the President of the Republic of Chile. It also houses the offices of the three cabinet ministers: Interior, General Secretariat of the Presidency, and General Secretariat of the Government. It occupies an entire block in downtown Santiago in the area known as Civic District between Moneda north side, Morandé east, Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins south, and Teatinos Street west.

Voice - 2021-08-22 - 2036

> Okay hello, what do you call this again? Daily (or so) daily check-in for voice training. Yeah, I still have colds, eh, but lately I've been, I don't know, practicing this pitch because it's the pitch I'm comfortable speaking in. I mean, I can practice deeper but I'd rather practice maintaining this pitch for now. Maintaining in the sense that I don't have to actively think about it, so yeah.

Voice - 2021-08-28 - 1747

> Okay hi, daily check-in for voice training. Okay, I've been skipping some days because of the colds and coughs, but now I guess I could say it's getting better because of the meds, so yeah. Hopefully I'll be back on track especially since it's a long weekend, Saturday to Monday, so I have three straight days of voice training. So, I'm wearing a face mask right now, so my voice might come out differently in the recording. So yeah, that's it, let's go.

Voice - 2021-08-29 - 1729

> Okay so, hello, daily check-in for voice training. I'm feeling better now, I'm not coughing, I don't have as much colds as I got in the past two or three weeks. So I guess the meds helped a lot, and I mean a lot. Well, we'll see, I'm due for some follow-up and tests, so we'll get the reason why we've been having colds and coughs for the longest time. So yeah, there you go.

Voice - 2021-08-30 - 1154

> Okay hello, daily check-in for voice training. I'm using the app Forest to track my activities to see whether I'm productive, whether I don't get distracted by unnecessary activities, so yeah. The good thing about that app is that it allows me to set which apps are permitted to be used while the timer on that app is [running?]. So, it's the first time I'm using it. I hope I'm getting good results. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go. 

Voice - 2021-09-01 - 1127

> Hi, hello, daily check-in for voice training. Okay, it's September now. I'll be honest: I kinda don't like the "September equals holidays" meme. Honestly, I haven't told anyone about this because I guess it's such an anti-cultural comment, but yeah I don't like it. We're so obssesed about the holidays, Christmas in particular, but I guess part of that is because I'm not religious, I don't know, I'm not hyped about any holidays during December. So yeah, I guess that's it for now, so here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-03 - 1134

> Okay hello, daily check-in for voice training. Well, I could say I've been doing well in terms of progress. Earlier I was speaking a bit, I noticed I'm not quite practicing the "speak from the belly" thing, so I guess more practice is needed for me to make it a conscious effort, like speaking from your belly so that the voice becomes as deep as possible. So yeah, I guess that's it, so here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-04 - 1117

> Okay hello, daily check-in for voice training. This one would be shorter because I'm going for swab test (yeah, I know) maybe just to confirm that it's not COVID, it's more of allergies. I just found out yesterday that they were indeed allergies, so I've been prescribed some meds, we're on our way to getting it, and yeah I'm going to have this swab test later, so yeah. I'm getting better at voice training especially because the allergies are going away I guess, like it's not as bad as before, and hopefully when I get on the meds it will be a lot better and I can maintain this voice for a longer period. So yeah, that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-07 - 1633

> Okay, daily check-in for voice training. I finally got my second dose now, I'm fully vaccinated, woo! Now, well again I've been speaking earlier and I admit that I need more practice in being conscious about speaking from the belly [some filler words]. Lot, lot, lot, a lot lot, a lot more practice so that speaking from the belly becomes a subconscious practice I guess. Well, I can't be on T yet, or maybe if I decide against it, maybe I don't know. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-08 - 1211

> Okay hello, daily check-in for voice training. I have to admit there's still a lot to go before I get used to the muscle mechanics, I would call it that, the muscle mechanics of voice training, especially speaking from the belly. More and more practice is needed so that I get the muscle memory to speak from my belly. So yeah, that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-09 - 1129

> Okay hello, daily check-in for voice training. Trying every day to practice the muscle mechanics like speaking from the belly. So based from how I hear myself I guess this is D or D sharp range. That's a good start especially for something that's spontaneous like when speaking in public [some filler words] or even at home actually. So yeah, progress is being made as always, practice makes perfect, and that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-10 - 1217

> Okay hello so daily check-in for voice training. I guess it gets better and better. I'm getting the hang of speaking from the belly by default, so I'm doing it now with [some filler words] less effort than I used to exert before. I guess the voice, how it turns out varies, but let's focus on the spontaneousness of speaking from the belly. So in that respect we're doing good. Of course, practice makes perfect. So I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-11 - 1409

> Okay hello so daily check-in for voice training. I think in the morning I did it, so I was able to speak from the belly first without effort, so the training is paying off well. So now, I notice I'm still getting high-pitched moments today. I think it has something to do with my throat not being fully clear because of the allergies. For now I'll just continue training and [some filler words, then clears throat] that's what I'm saying. So I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-12 - 1354

> Hello so daily check-in for voice training. It keeps better and better. I think my throat is getting clearer now I guess because I find it easier and easier to project my voice, so that's good news. I think I'm more than halfway through my allergy tablets, so I guess completing that would improve the clogging situation and would make me be able to sustain this kind of voice. So yeah, that's it, here we go. 

Voice - 2021-09-14 - 1133

> Hello so daily check-in for voice training. I was on a video call, I mean audio call, at work for the whole day and I will rate my voice at 6 over 10 because there were times when I nailed it but there were times when I default to my old voice. At the same time it made me think, hmmm what if I gave mixed signals about my gender using my voice, so they really can't tell what I am. And honestly that felt euphoric in a weird way. I guess I'll just keep that thought in mind however weird it sounds. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-15 - 1120

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. I think it's getting better now, like I was speaking for a bit earlier and for the most part I'm sustaining this voice, I mean this exact voice, so I guess it's good. I would rate myself 7 over 10. There are times when I do small talk that I forget the muscle mechanics. But as always, practice makes perfect. So let's cherish our achievements like today. So, that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-18 - 1722

> Okay, daily check-in for voice training. I had a call once again, not video call, audio call, and I would rate my voice 5 over 10 because for the most part I was able to keep it but I could hear I'm returning to my old voice. So yeah, as always, practice makes perfect, self-awareness of muscle movements also helps, and speaking slowly also helps. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-19 - 1612

> Okay so, daily check-in for voice training. I would say it's going well except for... (ugh, the dogs are barking every time I have to record) I'm having... my nose is acting up again because I was off my meds for a while, but I started them again in the hopes that my nose would go well again. I don't know what else to say aside from the fact that I hope I can hear myself through this recording. So yeah, that's it, here we go. 

Voice - 2021-09-20 - 1250

> Okay, daily check-in for voice training. I don't know what to say actually, aside from the fact that hey, I'm getting the hang of it now so that's great. But then my allergies are acting up again. It'll take a while of taking antihistamines just to clear it up. But I think this time it doesn't affect my voice. I think now I have an easier time to maintain this pitch, but I'm not sure how it will fare let's say in a call, like in an hour-or-two-long call, so yeah let's see. That's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-21 - 1011

> Hello so daily check-in for voice training. I think I'm getting better and better at impromptu talking I guess, because right now I guess it takes less effort for me to speak from [some filler words] as low as possible. So yeah, progress is being made. I want my throat to be as clear as possible, but my allergies are acting up yet again. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-25 - 1051

> Hello so daily check-in for voice training. I don't know, I feel kinda unmotivated because I couldn't find a better job sooner and overall I feel like my first job is kinda limiting because I had a limited set of responsibilities I guess. I feel bad about it overall. I wouldn't... I don't know, it's just disappointing. There were times when I thought "hmmm, I like my job", but I didn't expect I would be disappointed about my current job. Yeah, I'm done, that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-26 - 1724

> Hello, voice training, daily check-in. [some filler words] I still kinda forget the muscle mechanics, especially speaking from the belly. So I guess what I would do every morning is do vocal exercises, humming like "aaaaa", "ooooo" so that I can quote-unquote "exercise" my belly. So I guess let's continue with the voice training and I hope I can catch up so that it's more regular. Yeah, that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-27 - 1056

> Hello so daily check-in for voice training. So yeah, I don't know what to say. I guess the usual reminders like always speak from the belly, try my best to do so, and every morning do some vocalizations where my voice comes from the belly. I'm trying to speak as loud as possible, like project my voice. I'm trying it as I speak. I hope I sound good enough for this. So yeah, that's all I can say really, so let's just see later. That's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-09-29 - 1037

> Okay, daily check-in for voice training. Well, I don't know what to say. Still a lot of practice to go through before the voice and the muscle memory becomes subconscious. Something like... ahhh, I'm out of words... but I'm kinda far from that subconscious voice training. But yeah, it's nothing practice can't fix so let's just keep practicing. That's it for now, here we go.

Voice - 2021-10-01 - 1128

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. I'm getting better at it, I'm thinking positively. Practice is still recommended, well required. Actually as you may hear, I'm kinda straining right now to maintain my preferred voice, but that's because it's early and I haven't done any voice exercises yet. So this isn't a perfect voice for me obviously aside from the fact that my allergies are acting up. So I guess that's it for now, here we go.

Voice - 2021-10-02 - 1137

> Hello hello, so daily check-in for voice training. [some filler words] A little observation: during the morning, for example right now, it takes a bit for me to get the voice even with speaking from the belly I guess, it takes a while for me to default to my deep voice. I'm not sure whether it's in general or it's because my throat isn't doing well right now. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

Voice - 2021-10-04 - 1757

> Okay so this is my trained voice. What I notice as I speak is that all of the effort in speaking comes from the belly, like literally from the belly. My throat is really open, it doesn't exert effort. It feels comfortable around my throat area, like my belly is the one that's working hard. So that's my general technique for speaking. Yeah, that's it, I don't know what else to say.

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. I would say my progress is at 80 percent. I can pull it off most of the time but sometimes whenever I'm stressed or busy, I can't pull it off. It takes a significant amount of effort for me to pull the muscles, as I would say. Sometimes my allergy just acts up, makes my throat feel filled, so yeah that also affects my voice. So I guess that's it for now, here we go.

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. What do I say? I'm not sure. Adlibbing stuff. I'm supposed to do something productive but, I don't know, it's a Sunday and I'm supposed to rest because, you know, you spend 5 out of 7 days working or thinking about your future or whatever or, I don't know, being productive for the sake of quote-unquote "society". But for now I will wind down because, you know, this is one of the few days when I can, right? So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. I think I'm getting more confident about this so less straining, less effort, less everything, but to be fair I think my allergies are for the most part under control right now. As usual, the tips still applies, so speaking from the diaphragm, resonance, keeping the throat open and... What's the other tip again? Okay I forgot it, wait wait I forgot, oh my gosh... okay, I'm supposed to say something but I forgot it. Anyway so, yeah that's it, here we go.

> Okay so daily check-in for voice training. I don't know what to say. What do I adlib now? I'm not sure... okay so I'm gonna adlib about adlibbing. I do adlibbing whenever I record this voice training sample I guess. And it's hard to adlib most of the time. I don't have anything to say about adlibbing. Other than that I guess of course training is recommended every day but I'm currently applying for a job so voice training is paused for now, but we will always continue of course. And yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

> Hello, so daily check-in for voice training. Okay so, I didn't realize how much effort it takes to sound like this, it really takes conscious effort like this, like I'm exerting it right now but most of the time I forget to do that effort like speaking from the belly I guess. So yeah, I'm doing it right now I mean, it's just like it's a conscious effort, like you have to remember it every time. And to be fair, I haven't had a formal training in a while so I guess I should start again. Yeah, so I hope I get the job soon and that I don't have to deal with the job that I hate anymore. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

> Okay so, hello, voice training. I don't know what to say actually aside from the fact that until now it's still a conscious effort. Well, of course I haven't been voice training daily, but unlike before I think I already get the muscle mechanics. It's just that I need to be more conscious about it, I need to be more active I guess, and speaking from my diaphragm because it takes a bit of effort. I believe that with training it will be easier. So yeah, I guess that's it, here we go.

> Yeah, hello, daily check-in for voice training—well, not daily anymore, so I'm just going to say "check-in for voice training". [some filler words] This is not as easy as I thought. I don't have an internal sense of what sounds deep enough for me, that's why I get paranoid sometimes whenever I hit a bit of a higher note. It kinda shows here because of the pauses that I make but let's just work on it I guess and keep on checking my pitch, and more importantly resonance. So yeah, that's it, here we go.

> Okay so, long time no record I guess. I thnk I just recently realized that I could do better in terms of keeping this pitch. So what I have been doing is projecting upwards, like my voice comes from the belly but the movement is upwards, but when I shift the movement downwards it feels easier now. So I'm trying to use that technique and it's really easier, it makes me more confident that I can maintain this kind of voice. I hope I get to keep this up. So yeah, that's all for now, thanks.
