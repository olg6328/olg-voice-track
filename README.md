## voice training tips
My general technique is to breathe in and then project my voice through my belly with my throat as open as possible so that it doesn't feel like I'm straining it. It doesn't only take "muscle mechanics" as I call it but also hitting the right pitch range, and for me it really took a while to get both right. I started in July 2022 (I wasn't on T yet) and I still sometimes forget to speak from my diaphragm lol. I'm not yet at the point where it feels subconscious for me so I still practice whenever I can. 

This is my detailed path:

I started with this link: http://www.oulgbtq.org/your-voice.html. It covers the general tips but I needed some interactive help so I downloaded the EvaM app. 

EvaM has a free pitch tracker but its video content and self-guided exercises are paid, so I understand this app is not for everyone. If you can find free video tutorials then that's great! 

The app's instructor recommends taking short practices daily instead of bulk training for less risk of straining your voice.

The app's training process went like this: 
* Breathing exercises (breathe through your belly!)
* Pitch tuning exercises (I had a hard time with this because I didn't know how E3, C3 and A2 pitches sounded like when I produced it. This is where the free pitch tracker is useful: it lets me know that I'm actually humming at E3 or C3 rather than the higher pitches.) 
* Humming exercises, and then speaking words and phrases with the breathing + pitch techniques 

The muscle mechanics and pitch really go hand in hand, you can't reach lower pitches comfortably without "sourcing" your voice from your belly or chest. Belly is ideal but chest is a good start; it took me a while to know the difference and I wouldn't have known if I hadn't went for a kinda formal voice training.

Voice care tip: if you feel like you're having a hard time keeping your voice low (throat feels strained or tight or there's pain in the side), you're doing it wrong. It took me trial and error to find out how to have a deeper voice that's loud enough but doesn't hurt my throat.

## scripts used

### Wasteful
> The fact that charging takes an hour and a half from empty to full is also unacceptable at this price point, when other companies are churning out mid-rangers costing half the price, which take 20 minutes to charge much larger batteries. Oh, and those mid-rangers also feature the fast charging brick in the box, a "wasteful" approach in Samsung's view, which chose to save the environment by making some extra cash off of charger sales. Because that obviously makes sense, our sarcasm-filled selves feel the need to note.
>
> Seriously, there's no overstating this point: battery life on the Flip3 sucks, charging times suck too, and the fact that you have wireless charging as an option is nice to see but expected at this price point, and it doesn't really help alleviate the aforementioned issues in any way. Not to mention that at 10W, that will take hours to fully replenish the battery when it's dead.
