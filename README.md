## what's this

This is where I track my voice changes on testosterone (T) monthly via lossless .wav audio files! Recordings are taken in an acoustically conducive environment (i.e., the bathroom) using the Dolby On recorder app. Its default "Dolby On" setting which intends to minimize background noise and boost voices has a somewhat aggressive de-essing algorithm, so the S sounds may sound a bit off. I still use the app so that previous and current recordings can be more comparable regardless of which phone I use to record myself.

## summary

I used to voice train to speak with a lower voice, but I found that it took me a lot of physical effort to pull it off. I decided to go on HRT to eliminate voice dysphoria.

My voice visibly got lower around the [fourth month](https://github.com/olg6328/olg-voice-track?tab=readme-ov-file#year-0-month-04-march-2023) with minimal diaphragm effort. T also helps strengthen muscles, including my diaphragm during the first three months so that I can pull off a lower voice with less effort than I used to without T. My new voice became stable after the fourth month, but I'm still recording because I'm wondering if my voice can get any lower. Not that I'm unsatisfied with my new voice; in fact I love it! 

I take full-dose T through injections with testosterone undecanoate every ~~14~~ ~~10~~ 12 weeks (it took guesswork to find out the optimal interval for me). As always, your voice change experience may vary depending on your medical background, dosage, and route of administration. 

Let it be said that my HRT is supervised by a physician and I take blood tests regularly to measure T levels. While I understand that not everyone has access to a physician (let alone a non-binary friendly one), **I do not recommend DIY HRT for testosterone** due to risks of blood clots, heart attacks, diabetes, and whatnot. Please do DIY HRT at your own risk and always take care.

## voice training tips

*(First written in October 2021; for reference, I started T in November 2022)*

My general technique is to breathe in and then project my voice through my belly with my throat as open as possible so that it doesn't feel like I'm straining it. It doesn't only take "muscle mechanics" as I call it but also hitting the right pitch range, and for me it really took a while to get both right. I started in July 2021 (I wasn't on T yet) and I still sometimes forgot to speak from my diaphragm. I wasn't at the point where it felt subconscious for me so I still practiced whenever I can, until I gave up on December 2021 because speaking from my diaphragm daily took me too much effort.

This was my detailed path:

I started with this link: http://www.oulgbtq.org/your-voice.html. It covers the general tips:

> Experiment with your breathing. Try to breathe in from your diaphragm, rather than taking shallow breaths. If you take a breath and feel your chest and shoulders rise, you're breathing from your chest, not your diaphragm. When you breathe from your diaphragm, you should feel your stomach expanding and contracting. Inhale through your nose and down to your belly, and speak when you breathe out. When you speak from your diaphragm, you'll project more easily, and your voice will be a bit deeper. Try speaking through your mouth, rather than your nose. It's possible to get a deep nasal voice, but it sounds more masculine if you speak through your mouth.
>
> To deepen your voice, you'll want to try and lower your pitch. To do this, relax your throat as much as possible, to avoid tightening your vocal cords. Moisten your mouth and throat, and hold your chin up. Swallow before you speak, and speak slowly, lowering your voice at the beginning of your sentences and trying to maintain that pitch. If you find yourself speaking quickly, you'll probably also find your pitch rising. Try not to raise your pitch at the end of your sentences, but keep your tone more monotonous. Emphasise sounds that allow you to deepen your voice; for example, lengthening your vowels allows you to make them sound deeper. Experiment with what you find easiest to pronounce with your deeper voice and play to those strengths.
>
> When trying to deepen your voice, you quite literally want to speak from as low down as possible. Pay attention to where you feel and hear your voice emanating from; it'll probably be your throat. Your pitch is highest when you speak at the top of your throat, or when you use your 'head voice'. Speaking from your chest will produce a deeper sound, although it might be airy and a little soft. Ideally, you want to learn how to speak from what feels like your gut. To do this, you'll have to project your voice, which comes from breathing from your diaphragm and reaching down to your belly before you speak. This process of learning to speak from your diaphragm takes a lot of practice, and initially you probably won't hear much of a difference, but in time, you'll be able to make your voice deeper and deeper. It might be frustrating, but take baby steps. If you try to make drastic changes to your voice, you'll risk straining your vocal cords. Avoid speaking with a growl or rasp, as although this produces a deeper throat voice, it can damage your vocal cords and you'll end up with a hoarse voice. It's also more difficult to project when you're speaking from your throat.

However, I needed some interactive help so I downloaded the EvaM app. 

EvaM has a free pitch tracker but its video content and self-guided exercises are paid, so I understand this app is not for everyone. If you can find free video tutorials then that's great! 

The app's instructor recommends taking short practices daily instead of bulk training for less risk of straining your voice.

The app's training process went like this: 
* Breathing exercises (breathe through your belly!)
* Pitch tuning exercises such as saying "ooooo" and "aaaaa" at certain pitches (I had a hard time with this because I didn't know how E3, C3 and A2 pitches sounded like when I produced it. This is where the free pitch tracker is useful: it lets me know that I'm actually humming at E3 or C3 rather than the higher pitches.) 
* Humming exercises, and then speaking words and phrases with the breathing + pitch techniques 

The muscle mechanics and pitch really go hand in hand, you can't reach lower pitches comfortably without "sourcing" your voice from your belly or chest. Belly is ideal but chest is a good start; it took me a while to know the difference and I wouldn't have known if I hadn't went for a kinda formal voice training.

Voice care tip: if you feel like you're having a hard time keeping your voice low (throat feels strained or tight or there's pain in the side), you're doing it wrong. It took me trial and error to find out how to have a deeper voice that's loud enough but doesn't hurt my throat.

### Wasteful

> The fact that charging takes an hour and a half from empty to full is also unacceptable at this price point, when other companies are churning out mid-rangers costing half the price, which take 20 minutes to charge much larger batteries. Oh, and those mid-rangers also feature the fast charging brick in the box, a quote-unquote "wasteful" approach in Samsung's view, which chose to save the environment by making some extra cash off of charger sales. Because that obviously makes sense, our sarcasm-filled selves feel the need to note.
>
> Seriously, there's no overstating this point: battery life on the Flip3 sucks, charging times suck too, and the fact that you have wireless charging as an option is nice to see but expected at this price point, and it doesn't really help alleviate the issues in any way. Not to mention that at 10 watts, that will take hours to fully replenish the battery when it's dead.
